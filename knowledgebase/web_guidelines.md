# Web Sourced Mortgage Guidelines

## NMLS / CSBS (https://www.csbs.org/nationwide-multistate-licensing-system)
- NMLS is the official system of record that state banking agencies, D.C., and U.S. territories use for licensing, renewing, or surrendering non-depository financial services authorities (including mortgage companies and MLOs).
- Applicants and licensees manage the full lifecycle (apply → amend → renew → surrender) directly inside NMLS; the modernization roadmap focuses on easing regulator + industry UX.
- NMLS Consumer Access provides a free, public lookup so borrowers can confirm whether a company or individual is authorized to originate in their state before sharing PII.
- State Examination System (SES) integrates with NMLS to connect regulators and supervised entities through exams and condition tracking.

## VA.gov (https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/)
- VA direct or VA-backed loans help qualified Veterans, service members, and surviving spouses buy, build, improve, or refinance while often waiving down payments (nearly 90% close with 0% down).
- Borrowers still need sufficient credit/income, but VA guarantees can improve pricing and fees compared to conventional loans.
- Eligibility hinges on obtaining a Certificate of Eligibility (COE); VA explains how to request it online and what documentation is needed.
- Programs include purchase loans, Native American Direct Loans, IRRRL (streamline refi), and cash-out refis.
- VA provides foreclosure-avoidance assistance for borrowers struggling with payments and publishes warnings about unsolicited refinance solicitations.
